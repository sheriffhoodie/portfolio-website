  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Who am I? I am a full-stack software developer with experience making web and mobile applications with Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Javascript, HTML/CSS, React/Redux, React Native, and Google Firebase. I am a Johns Hopkins grad from New Jersey
    looking to join a great team, engineer great products and make a great impact. I am a part-time suburban farm-boy, most-of-the-time Mets fan (sometimes it gets too painful), and a full-time problem-solver.</br></br>Why coding? One of my
    lifelong passions has been learning languages, including studying four of them in college and studying abroad. Now I'm taking my talents from the caf√© tables of Paris to the keyboard, getting into as many new coding languages and libraries as I
    can, and I am loving it.</p>
